#  Privacy Policy for GAEN Analytics

The only internet connections made by the app are to download data from the ENPA and ENCV servers using the API keys provided by the user.

All ENPA and ENCV data is kept private to the app except as exported by the user as csv files. The ENCV data is persisted by the app so it can be retained longer than the 90 day limit on data stored on the ENCV server. 

No data or analytics about usage of the app is collected.
