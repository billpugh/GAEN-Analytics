This is the encv composite data, along with sms error data if you have enabled the Twillio webhook. 

Each row is the data for a single day.

This has all the columns from the composite-stats file downloaded from the ENCV server. This file can we saved or shared to provide historical ENCV data to GAEN Analyzer (since the ENCV server only retains data for 90 days).
