Android ENPA data


This provides combined ENPA data for just Android devices. Most of the numbers from individual metrics are rates per 100K reporting devices (including standard deviation). 

There was an error in the Android implementation of ENPA that was fixed in November 2021; due to this bug, no actual ENPA events were recorded by Android devices from April through mid November 2021 (but the devices were still counted as reporting ENPA data). To keep this from skewing the data, Android data from before mid-November have been dropped.
