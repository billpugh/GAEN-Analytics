The worksheet provides many columns from all three of the ENPA exports as well as the ENCV analysis. All rows are seven day rolling averages. 

This worksheet allows for comparison of metrics from iOS and Android platforms, and also provides columns showing several different ways to compute the estimated number of total ENX users. 

If there are additional columns or computations you would like to see adding, please let me know.
