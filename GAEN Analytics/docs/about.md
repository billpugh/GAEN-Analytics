**GAEN Analyzer**

This app allows public health agencies that are using GAEN, the Google/Apple exposure notification system, to download, analyze and export the analytics made available from the ENPA and ENCV servers. In order to use this app, you must have created apiKeys for your organization through the ENPA and ENCV portals. It will work if you only have an apiKey for one of the two servers. 

All data is rolling 7-day averages. The ENPA metrics include noise due to differential privacy.
