**GAEN Analyzer**

This app allows public health agencies that are using GAEN, the Google/Apple exposure notification system, to download, analyze and export the analytics made available from the ENPA and ENCV servers. In order to use this app, you must have created apiKeys for your organization through the ENPA and ENCV portals. It will work if you only have an apiKey for one of the two servers. 

All data is rolling 7-day averages. The ENPA metrics include noise due to differential privacy. 

All ENPA and ENCV data is kept private to the app except as exported by the user as csv files. 

The GAEN Analyzer is under active development to help public health authorities access, interprete and understand 
their ENPA and ENCV analytics. It  is open source, available at https://github.com/billpugh/GAEN-Analytics, under 
the MIT license. So far, all of the code has been contributed written by Professor Bill Pugh, University of Maryland.
