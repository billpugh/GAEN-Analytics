To create an ENPA API key, log into the ENPA portal, click on organizations, and then Access Management in the left menu.

Under the section API Keys, click on "Add API Key".

Use cut and paste to save the API key; once you dismiss the page showing you the API key, the web site won't ever show you the full API key again.
