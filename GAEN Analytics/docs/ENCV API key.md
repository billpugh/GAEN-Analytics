To create an ENCV API key, log into the ENCV server, click on the triangle in the upper right, and select API keys. Then select the + in the upper right below the triangle. Set the type to be Stats, and give it an Application name so you can find it later and see how often it has been used or delete it. 

Click the "Create API Key" button. 

Use cut and paste to save the API key; once you dismiss the page showing you the API key, the web site won't ever show you the full API key again.
