This shows the relative risk for people who have received an exposure notification and people who have not received a notification. This is one of the metrics used in the Nature paper [Epidemiological impacts of the NHS COVID-19 app in England and Wales throughout its first year](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36495-z).

Each of these denotes the number of people out of 100,000 people that will verify a code. For example, if vcr+1 is 3,000, that means that out of 100,000 category 1 notifications, 3,000 people tested positive and verified a code. This metric is not calculated for days where there is cases and notifications are too low to allow for calculation with low noise.  

* vcr-n the risk to people who have not received a notification. 
* vcr+1 the risk to people who received a notification category 1
* vcr+2 the risk to people who received a notification category 2
