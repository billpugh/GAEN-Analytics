This graph shows the probability distribution of the delay between an exposure and when the user receives notification of their exposure. 

The x-axis is the number of days delay between the exposure and when the user receives notification of their exposure. 
For example, if the value for 4 days is 18%, that means that 18% of users received their notification 4 days after exposure. 

If you add up all the values from different days for a notification, they will total to 100%.

This data is computed from the dateExposure14d metric, which only started being collected in 2022, and at the moment is only analyzed for iOS.
