Shows an estimate of the total number of active ENX users (users running ENX for the region who are actively scanning for encounters). From the ENPA data, we get the total number of users in the region that have opted into ENPA. We then divide the number of ENPA users by the percentage of users that have opted into ENPA to get the total number of ENX users. 

We can calculate the estimated number of active ENX users using either the calculated ENPA opt-in data for the region, or use the US national ENPA opt-in data. The regional data reflects regional differences, but also tends to be very noisy and calculates the ENPA opt-in ration only from those users who verify codes. 

Total users = (# of ENPA users)/(ENPA opt in)

Although the regional calculation incorporates regional differences, I recommend that regions use calculation that uses the US ENPA % as the best estimate of ENPA opt-in in their region. The noise in the  calculation using regional opt-in and the fact that it is measuring a different population than all ENPA users make it a less reliable measurement. The calculation using regional opt-in continues to be displayed in the tool because it is the metric that was historically reported by GAEN Analyzer.
