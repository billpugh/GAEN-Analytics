Of the people who have an detected infectious encounter on a day, this shows the cumulative distribution of the score for the most infectious 30 minute period (i.e., the most infectious exposure window). This scorescore takes into account both the weighted duration and infectiousness of the encounter.

This data is computed from the UserRisk metric.
