This graph shows the cummulative probability distribution curve for the delay between a user receiving an exposure and the user receiving a notification category 2 of that exposure. For example, nt2-de6% gives the percentage of category 2 notifications that were received within 6 days of exposure. 

This data is computed from the dateExposure14d metric, which only started being collected in 2022, and at the moment is only analyzed for iOS.
