This graph shows the cumulative distribution of the attenuation at which encounters are detected with people who have shared their diagnosis.

For example, the <= 60 dB % line shows that of encounters detected what percentage of that time was at 60 dB or less of attenuation. 

This data is computed from the UserRiskParameters metric.
