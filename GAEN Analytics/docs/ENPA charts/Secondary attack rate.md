This chart shows the secondary attack rate (sar%), calculated from ENPA data as

secondary attacks = people who verify a code and had received an exposure notification that was still being shown on their phone
secondary attack rate = secondary attacks / number of notifications received 5 days ago

For regions with multiple exposure classifications, this calculation is done seperately for each notification.

The graph also shows the standard deviation for each secondary attack rate, based on the standard deviation in the number of secondary attacks. As the number of notifications increases/decreases, the standard deviation of the sar% decreases/increases.

You should consider the secondary attack rate reliable only on days when it is at least twice the standard deviation. To decrease noise in the graph, the secondary attack rate is plotted as 0% on days when the calculated sar% is less than the standard deviation in the sar%. 

Understanding and interpreting secondary attack rate is the subject of much current thought and discussion.  See [discussion of Excess secondary attack rates](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V3lKaLCNBNwuUfEcwhyyVVQOwafHmC78iMICZPraOUk/edit?usp=sharing). Also, the offset of 5 days for the denominator of secondary is arbitrary, but in the right ballpark.
