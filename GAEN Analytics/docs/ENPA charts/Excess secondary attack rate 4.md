This chart shows the *excess* secondary attack rate (sar%) fpr category 4 notifications.

If exposure notifications were being generated completely at random, some people would happen to get an exposure notification and then test positive in the next week or so, while the notification was still being shown on their phone, and thus would be counted as secondary attack.

*Excess* secondary attacks are the number of secondary attacks above what would be expected if exposure notifications were generated at random, and the *excess* secondary attack rate is calculated by dividing by the number of notifications from 4 days prior.
