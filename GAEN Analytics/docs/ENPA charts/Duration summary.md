This text describes the distribution of exposure durations. It only considers encounters where there is at least 3 minutes of weighted duration to someone who is infectious (technically, where the perDayMaxScore is at least 3). 

For example, it might show that of all detected encounters, 40% had an perDaySumScore of 15 minutes or longer. 

From this data, we can calculate things such as what would be the increase in exposure notifications if a region switched from a 15 minute exposure threshold to a 10 threshold, or what percent of encounters are two hours or longer. 

This calculation has not yet been validated against data from states that have multiple exposure classifications with different threshold durations. Such validation is eagerly sought.
