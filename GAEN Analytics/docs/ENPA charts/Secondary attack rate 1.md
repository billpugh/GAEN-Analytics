This chart shows the secondary attack rate (sar%) fpr category 1 notifications, calculated as

secondary attacks = people who verify a code and had received an exposure notification 1 that was still being shown on their phone
secondary attack rate = secondary attacks / number of notifications 

The graph shows the calculated sar%, along with one standard deviation above and below that line. 

Note that the values for each day are not independent (unless are not using rolling averages). For determining the statistical significance of calculated secondary attack rate, you may wish to use +/- two standard deviations, and look at values separated by the rolling average period (e.g., if you are using 7 day rolling averages, use values 7 days apart).

Understanding and interpreting secondary attack rate is the subject of much current thought and discussion.  See [discussion of Excess secondary attack rates](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V3lKaLCNBNwuUfEcwhyyVVQOwafHmC78iMICZPraOUk/edit?usp=sharing). Also, the offset of 7 days for the denominator of secondary is arbitrary, but in the right ballpark.
