This graph shows, by platform, the percentage of scan instances that are received with an attenuation less than or equal to several different thresholds. 

For example, it includes both Android <= 55 dB % and iOS <= 60 dB %. For some states, those two lines are roughtly equal, even those the attenuation thresholds are different. 

That could be due some combination of different user behavior for the two platforms, and differences in reported attenuations. If there is no difference in user behavior between the two platforms, that suggests that the encounters than are reported as <= 55 dB on Android are being reported as <= 60 dB on iOS. 

This data is computed from the UserRiskParameters metric.
