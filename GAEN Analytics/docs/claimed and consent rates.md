Shows the % of codes issued that are *claimed* and the % of users that claimed their codes who go on to *consent* to share their diagnosis.

This is from the ENCV metrics, includes all users and doesn't include generated noise as the ENPA metrics do. 

Codes are *claimed* when the user verifies a code (the terminology used by ENPA). 

Tokens are *claimed* when a user who verifies a code goes on to share their diagnosis. 

claim rate = (# of codes claimed)/(# of codes issued)
consent rate = (# of tokens claimed)/(# of codes claimed)
